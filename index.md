    abstract: "We study the effect of entitlement on the willingness to lie. We set up a theoretical model where entitlement causes some individuals to think they are more deserving of their endowment than others. When given the opportunity to lie to keep their endowment, individuals who feel relatively deserving are encouraged to lie while others are discouraged. To test the model predictions we use a laboratory experiment where we compare the lying behavior of participants endowed with a high endowment and participants endowed with a low endowment. In one treatment, the allocation of the endowment is decided by participantsâ€™ performance, and in the other, it is determined by a random draw. When participants lie to keep money directly determined by their performance, those who receive the high endowment lie more than those who receive the low endowment. In contrast, when income is determined by a random draw, lying is the same regardless of the endowment."

  - name: Signaling motives in lying games
    collab: none

    abstract: "Theoretical models of lying often incorporate image concerns. They usually assume that agents have an image concern that depends on the probability with which an observer believes they lied. I develop an image model where agents instead want to appear of honest character, which they do by signaling a high intrinsic moral cost of lying. A signaling motive emerges where agents dislike being suspected of lying and where some types liars are more stigmatized than others. I test the theoretical predictions in an experiment. In contrast previous literature, the experimental results show no evidence that image concerns influence lying behavior in the laboratory."
