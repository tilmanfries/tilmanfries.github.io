    abstract: "Modern life offers nearly unbridled access to information; it is the harnessing of this information to guide decision-making that presents a challenge.
    In this paper, we study how one individual may try to shape how another individual interprets objective information by proposing a causal explanation (or narrative) that makes sense of this objective information. Using an experiment, we study the use of narratives as a persuasive tool in the context of financial advice, where advisors may hold incentives that differ from those of the individuals they are advising. Our results reveal several insights about the underlying mechanisms that govern narrative persuasion. First, we show evidence that advisors construct self-interested narratives and make them persuasive by tailoring them to fit the objective information. Second, we demonstrate that advisors are able to shift investors' beliefs about the future performance of a company. Third, we identify the types of narratives that investors adopt, namely those that fit the objective
    information well. Finally, we evaluate the efficacy of several potential policy interventions aimed at protecting investors. We find that narrative persuasion is difficult to protect against."

    abstract: "This paper studies the implications of agents signaling their moral type in a lying game. In the theoretical analysis, a signaling motive emerges where agents dislike being suspected of lying and where some lies are more stigmatized than others. The equilibrium prediction of the model can explain experimental data from previous studies, in particular on partial lying, where individuals lie to gain a non payoff-maximizing amount. I discuss the relationship with theoretical models of lying that conceptualize the image concern as an aversion to being suspected of lying and provide applications to narratives, learning, and the disclosure of lies."

    abstract: Experimental participants in a cheating game draw a random number and then report any number they wish, receiving a monetary payoff based only on the report. We study how these reports depend on the level of observability of both the random draw and the report by the experimenter. Our results show that whereas increasing the observability of the random draw decreases cheating, increasing the anonymity of the reports does not affect average reports.

    abstract: "We study the effect of entitlement on the willingness to lie. We set up a model of lying where individuals feel more or less entitled to their endowment  depending on how they earned it. When given the opportunity to lie to keep their endowment, individuals who feel more entitled are encouraged to lie while others are discouraged. To test the model predictions we use a laboratory experiment where we compare the lying behavior of participants endowed with a high endowment and participants endowed with a low endowment. In one treatment, the allocation of the endowment is decided by participants' performance, and in the other, it is determined by a random draw. Our study shows that deservingness influences lying in an intuitive direction: when participants' performance determines income, those who earn less money lie less than those who earn more. We do not find differences in lying when participants perform the same task but lie to keep windfall endowments."

    abstract: "Social media and internet search engines give easy access to information about others. This paper studies the behavioral consequences when individuals learn more about others they interact with. In principle, as observers learn about decision makers, this limits the ability of decision makers to signal their type through their actions. I provide experimental evidence in support of this theoretical mechanism. In addition, I explore specific channels that can potentially uphold high levels of prosocial behavior over time. I find that imperfect memory&mdash;the observer forgetting what they learned about the decision-maker in the past&mdash;helps to keep prosocial behavior at high levels. However, I also find that individuals are generally not forgiving; they believe that those who acted egoistically in the past will remain egoistic in the future. This lowers the supply of prosocial behavior over time."

    abstract: "We study whether motivated reasoning influences the narratives that individuals are willing to adopt. Specifically, we test whether individuals find narratives more plausible when they like, rather than dislike, the consequences implied by the narrative. In our experiment, an investor observes historical data from a particular company and decides whether or not to invest in the company. After taking this decision, the investor meets with a financial advisor who proposes an explanation of the companyâ€™s historical data to the investor. The investor may then update her beliefs about the company. Our preliminary results indicate that investors tend to reject narratives that contradict past choices they made&mdash;i.e., they reject narratives that suggest that their past investment choices were bad. We do not find any such effect if investors are instead exogenously endowed with an investment in the company. This implies that the <i>act of choosing</i> to invest or not is responsible for the motivated reasoning effect we observe."

    abstract: "Researchers commonly use probabilistic lying tasks to study preferences for truth-telling. In these tasks, individuals first draw a state from a known distribution and then make a report. Individuals receive a payment based only on the report. When analyzing data from these tasks, researchers have to rely on reports as draws remain unobserved. This paper shows how common analysis methods can get the size and the direction of the effect of a variable on lying wrong. The paper then presents an empirical model which overcomes this problem. It provides three applications. The first application shows how the empirical model can combine data from different lying tasks. The second application unties factors that influence intrinsic and extrinsic lying costs. The third application uses the model in structural estimation. I also provide code that implements the model in Stata."

I am a microeconomist, with a focus on behavioral and experimental economics. My current research focuses on how belief-based utility impacts strategic decision making and belief formation.
