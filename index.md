    abstract: "This paper studies, theoretically and experimentally, whether the entitlement effect created by deservingness affects the willingness to lie. In a laboratory experiment, we compare the lying behavior of high-endowment participants with low-endowment participants. In one treatment, the allocation of the endowment is decided by participants' effort, and in the other, it is determined by a random draw. When participants lie to keep money directly determined by their effort, those who receive the high endowment lie more than those who receive the low endowment. In contrast, when income is determined by a random draw, lying is the same regardless of the endowment. These findings are consistent with our model of relative entitlement concerns where less deserving individuals are discouraged from lying because they believe that other individuals are more deserving than themselves."

    abstract: "Theoretical models of lying often incorporate image concerns. They usually assume that individuals care about a social image that depends on the probability with which an observer believes they lied. I develop an image model where agents instead want to appear intrinsically honest. The model identifies an additional effect that might influence lying. In addition to not liking being suspected of lying, observers might be more tolerant of liars that have good reasons to lie. I test the theoretical predictions in an experiment. In contrast to the previous literature, the experimental results show no evidence that image concerns influence lying behavior. I investigate the relationship between beliefs and behavior and conclude that beliefs about lying have little causal influence on behavior."

I am interesterd in Behavioral Economics and Game Theory. In my research, I aim to combine theory with empirical methods.
