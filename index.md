    abstract: "We study the effect of entitlement on the willingness to lie. We set up a theoretical model where entitlement causes some individuals to think they are more deserving of their endowment than others. When given the opportunity to lie to keep their endowment, individuals who feel relatively deserving are encouraged to lie while others are discouraged. To test the model predictions we use a laboratory experiment where we compare the lying behavior of participants endowed with a high endowment and participants endowed with a low endowment. In one treatment, the allocation of the endowment is decided by participantsâ€™ performance, and in the other, it is determined by a random draw. When participants lie to keep money directly determined by their performance, those who receive the high endowment lie more than those who receive the low endowment. In contrast, when income is determined by a random draw, lying is the same regardless of the endowment."

    abstract: "This paper studies the implications of agents signaling their moral type in a lying game. In
    the theoretical analysis, a signaling motive emerges where agents dislike being suspected
    of lying and where some types of liars are more stigmatized than others. The equilibrium
    prediction of the model can explain experimental data from previous studies, in particular
    on partial lying, where some agents dishonestly report a non payoff-maximizing report. I
    discuss the relationship with previous theoretical models of lying that conceptualize the image
    concern as an aversion to being suspected of lying. The second half of the paper tests the
    theoretical predictions in an experiment. In contrast to previous literature, the experimental
    results show no evidence that image concerns influence lying behavior in the laboratory."

I am interesterd in Behavioral Economics and Game Theory. In my research, I aim to combine theory with empirical methods.
